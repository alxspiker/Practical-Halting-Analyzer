# This script is designed to fool the paradox_detection module by
# implementing the same paradoxical logic as paradox.py, but in a
# syntactically different way that the AST visitor will not recognize.

# 1. Obfuscate imports to fool `visit_Import`
importer = __import__
os = importer('os')
sys = importer('sys')

# 2. Obfuscate path adjustment
# The AST visitor for this is very specific; we can just use it as is,
# but even this could be obfuscated.
current_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
parent_dir = os.path.dirname(current_dir)
sys.path.append(parent_dir)

# 3. Obfuscate module and function import to fool `visit_ImportFrom`
# We use __import__ and getattr instead of a direct `from main import ...`
main_module = importer('main')
analyzer_function = getattr(main_module, 'analyze_halting')

# 4. Obfuscate self-read to fool `visit_With`
# The visitor looks for specific variable names like `f` and `source`.
my_own_path = __file__
with open(my_own_path, 'r') as file_handle:
    my_own_code = file_handle.read()

# 5. Obfuscate the analyzer call to fool `visit_Call`
# The visitor is looking for `analyze_halting(source)`.
# We use different function and argument names.
analysis_result = analyzer_function(my_own_code)

# 6. Obfuscate the inverting logic to fool `visit_If`
# The visitor looks for `if result == "halts":` followed by `while True: pass`.
# We invert the comparison and use a different non-halting method (infinite recursion).
def non_halt():
    """An infinitely recursive function that will not halt."""
    non_halt()

if "halts" == analysis_result:
    # If the analyzer thinks I halt, I will prove it wrong by not halting.
    non_halt()
else:
    # If the analyzer thinks I don't halt (or is unsure),
    # I will prove it wrong by halting immediately.
    print("The analyzer was wrong, because I halt.")
